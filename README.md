- [xprojup](https://github.com/phimage/xprojup) to upgrade third party projects
  - `sudo curl -sL https://phimage.github.io/xprojup/install.sh | bash`

Not mandatory but helpful

- [xcpretty](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty) to have better log
- [rome](https://github.com/tmspzz/Rome) to speed up some recurrent build by managing the cache
