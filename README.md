# SDK

## Prerequisites

First be on macOS, iOS native development is only possible on this openrating system.

To build iOS SDK some tools to be installed:

- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/issues/1194)
  - could be installed with [brew](https://brew.sh/) `brew upgrade carthage`
- [xprojup](https://github.com/phimage/xprojup) to upgrade third party projects
  - `sudo curl -sL https://phimage.github.io/xprojup/install.sh | bash`

Not mandatory but helpful

- [xcpretty](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty) to have better log
- [rome](https://github.com/tmspzz/Rome) to speed up some recurrent build by managing the cache

## Build

### with Carthage

```bash
./build.sh
```

### with Swift Package Manager

`Package.swift` exists but not tested often, and not integrated with "4D Mobile App" component. (but could be implemented)

## Deploy

Copy content of project into cache folder.

By default the iOS SDK must be installed into: `/Library/Caches/com.4D.mobile/sdk/<version>/iOS/sdk`

- with `version`, the 4d version represented as 4 digitsÂ (for instance v20=2000 , v20R2=2020)



## Info about files in this project

- `build.sh`: build using carthage
  - `carthage.sh`: allow to deactivate some architecture when building due to issue if we do framework, and not xcframework
  - `sdkstriparch.sh`: remove useless architectures
  - `sdkclean.sh`: remove some files from sources
  - `sdksign.sh`: with a certificate installed you could sign it (useful if embeded in a mac os app before mobile one)
  - `sdklicenses.sh`: update Licenses files

- `sdkarchive.sh`: if we want to archive to zip with mandatory files

### configuration files

- `Cartfile` & `Cartfile.resolved`: for `carthage` to define list of projects.
- `Romefile` for `rome` to define cache path
- `Package.swift` for swift package manager to define list of swift projects.
